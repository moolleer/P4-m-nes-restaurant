## Testing

### Lighthouse

I have checked the accessibility of the site using lighthouse.


### W3C Validator Tools

#### HTML

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org) to check for any errors within the HTML pages.

I had a stray end tag.

After I removed it no error was found.

#### CSS

For CSS I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 

No errors were detected.

#### JavaScript

I used  [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for errors within my JavaScript script tags.
I only had one function used from Code institute Walktrough Project, and I have not made any changes to the code.

#### Python

To check for errors in my Python files I used [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

No issues or errors were found. Please see the results for each page below.

## Accessibility

Usually Lighthouse is used for accessibility testing, but at the time of testing Lighthouse didnt work.
Therefore I have used [Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://wave.webaim.org/) instead.

<details>
  <summary>Home Page - No errors</summary>
  The contrast errors will be changed to a larger text, and different color in future development for increased accessibility.
